### 1.1 Overview of OpenShift and its Architecture

OpenShift is Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized apps, adding rich features like a web UI, CI/CD, integrated security, and developer tools. OpenShift has 4 different flavors: 
- OpenShift origin, which is the original upstream open source project from which all other models are derived. 
- The OpenShift online is Red hat's publicly hosted version of OpenShift origin, available for application development and hosting purposes. 
- OpenShift dedicated is a managed private cluster on cloud platforms like AWS and Google. 
- OpenShift enterprise is the on premise private pass offering of OpenShift.

</p>

- In this course we will focus on OpenShift Origin, OpenShift origin is based on top of Docker containers and the Kubernetes Cluster Manager, with added developer and operational centric tools that enable rapid application development, deployment and lifecycle management.

- **Key Features:**  
  Integrated developer tools, security, operators.
- **Core Architecture:**  
  Control Plane (API server, etcd), Worker Nodes, SDN, Registry, OAuth, Router, Monitoring/Logging.

* **Master Node**: Manages the cluster with components like API, scheduler, and etcd (data store).
* **Worker Nodes**: Run containerized applications (pods) on RHEL.
* **Developers** use Git and CI/CD to deploy apps; **Operations** use automation tools for management.
* **Routing Layer** handles external traffic; **Service Layer** manages internal communication.
* **Persistent Storage** and **Registry** support stateful apps and image management.
* Supports **physical, virtual, private, public, and hybrid** deployments.

### 1.2 Difference between Kubernetes and OpenShift

| Criteria | OpenShift | Kubernetes| 
| -------- | --------- | --------- | 
| Architecture | Monolithic | Modular|
| Product vs Project | Commerical Product | Open-Source Project |
| User interface (UI) | Web console with login page | Kubernetes dashboard | 
| Templates vs Helm | Project-specific templates | Helm charts for broader use | 
| Image Registry | Built-in registry | No built-in registry | 
| CICD | CI/CD tools integrated | Requires external tools | 
| Community and support | commercial support available | Open-Source community support|
| Networking | Rich set of networking features | Core Networking Features| 

- OpenShift **includes** Kubernetes but adds a web UI, secure-by-default settings, integrated image management, CI/CD, and Service Mesh.
- Use case: OpenShift automates what vanilla Kubernetes leaves as "do it yourself".
