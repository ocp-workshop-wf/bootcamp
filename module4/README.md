## ðŸ”¹ Module 4: Application Deployment and Management 


### 4.1 Secrets

- Secrets: a Kubernetes resource designed to hold sensitive information like passwords, API keys, certificates, and other credentials.
  - Basic Auth
  - SSH Key 
  - TLS Auth


**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- Create an Opaque secret

```bash
oc create secret generic message-secret --from-literal MESSAGE="secret message"
```
> output: secret/message-secret created

- Lets find out where it is!

```bash
oc get secret
```
> output: "message-secret        Opaque            10s"

- Lets open the yaml for that secret.

```bash
oc get -o yaml secrete/message-secret
```
> output:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: c2VjcmV0IG1lc3NhZ2U=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-19T03:42:04Z"
  name: message-secret
  namespace: raafat-dev
  resourceVersion: "3334020540"
  uid: d1e28fce-ab5d-45a3-8e9f-526f83d20135
type: Opaque
```
- This message is base64.

- How to use a Secret as environment variables

```bash
oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
```bash
oc expose svc/hello-world /
oc status
```
```bash
curl <url from oc status> 
```

> output: "Welcome! You can change this message by editing the MESSAGE environment variable."

```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from secret/message-secret
```
> output: "deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated"

```bash
curl <URL from oc status>
```
> output: "secret message"

```bash
oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world
```
```yaml
  .....
 - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              key: MESSAGE
              name: message-secret
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world@sha256:2311b7a279608de9547454d1548e2de7e37e981b6f84173f2f452854d81d1b7e
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world
      .......
```
---

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For secrets, you will update a secret value by modifying its definition. Start with the following secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: YmFzZTY0
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lab-secret
type: Opaque
```
- Create a new file and put the above YAML inside
- Update the value of MESSAGE to "Hello from Lab Secret"
- Create a secret based on this YAML using `oc create -f`
- Deploy and expose the Hello World Application
- Set the MESSAGE environment varaible using the secret.
---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- Output from `oc get secret` contains your new Secret

- Output from `oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world` contains the string "secretKeyRef"

- When you run `curl <your route>` you get the value you put in the Secret

---

### 4.2 Images and Image Streams 
An image is a self-contained package containing everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. An image stream, on the other hand, is a way to manage and track different versions of an image within OpenShift, acting as a virtual image repository. 

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image-imagestream.png" alt="Image & Image Streams Arch" style="width:500px; align="center"/>
</p>

**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- How to create an ImageStream

```bash
oc get is
```
> output: 

| Name  | IMAGE REPOSITORY |  TAGS |UPDATED|
| -------- | ------- | ------- | -----| 
| Hello-World  | `default-route-openshift-image-registry..` | latest | 27 hours ago|          
---
```bash
oc delete is/hello-world
```
> output: "imagestream.image.openshift.io "hello-world" deleted"

- Lets import the image now.

```bash
oc import-image --confirm quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
```
> output: "imagestream.image.openshift.io/hello-world imported" In addition to image description such as: 

```bash
Name:                   hello-world
Namespace:              raafat-dev
Created:                Less than a second ago
Labels:                 <none>
Annotations:            openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2025-07-19T05:09:16Z
Image Repository:       default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.rm3.7wse.p1.openshiftapps.com/raafat-dev/hello-world
Image Lookup:           local=false
Unique Images:          1
Tags:                   1

latest
  tagged from quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
```
- To get more information
```bash
oc get istag
```
- Once you have the name run the command to describe it:

```md
oc describe istag/<name>:latest
```
- What can you even do with an imagestream after importing it to OpenShift?
> you can easier to deploy a new app using that image

```bash
oc new-app myproject/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
- How to add more ImageStreamTags
```bash
oc tag quay.io/image-name:tag image-name:tag
```
- Syntax (oc tag `<orignial>` `<destination>`)
```bash
oc tag quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world:update-message hello-world:update-message
```
> output:"Tag hello-world:update-message set to quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world:update-message"

```bash
oc get is
```
> output: you should be able to see `update-message` on the tag

```bash
oc get istag
```

> output: you should see both images with the tag `latest` and `update-message`

- Lets learn how to push a private image on quay.io
- locate credentials.env file and update it with your Quay.io credentials.

```bash
source credentials.env
```
```bash
cd ./labs-repo/hello-world-go-private
```
```bash
cat Dockerfile
```
- Now we need to push the image, but we need to be very careful about the syntax for remote tags

|HOST|Repository|Image Name (:tag)|
| ----| ---- | ----|
|quay.io|/`$REGISTRY_USERNAME`$|/private-repo
---
```bash
docker build -t quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo .
```
>output "[+] Building 16.8s (5/5) FINISHED"

```bash 
docker login quay.io
```
- Push 
```docker push quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo
```
> output: Access your quay.io and look for private-repo with a red lock on it which means its private, also on your terminal you should see something like this: 

```bash
The push refers to repository [quay.io/`USERNAME`/private-repo]
7b2225181d6b: Pushed 
08684ee472f3: Pushed 
c732a2540651: Pushed 
552574c585c3: Pushed 
c8dae7ec6990: Pushed 
aad63a933944: Pushed 
0dd0829302c5: Pushed 
aaed0f9cbe2b: Pushed 
latest: digest: sha256:813277ad25de25d77aee81727dc6a27751434294682b922c8ae97966a1ac1faf size: 856
```


- How to run this private image to OpenShift?

```bash
oc new-app quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo --as-deployment-config
```
> output: 
```bash
.......
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "private-repo" created
    service "private-repo" created
......
```
- In case you get an Authentication error, you need to run the following command
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry \ demo-image-pull-secret \
--docker-server=$REGISTRY_HOST \
--docker-username=$REGISTRY_USERNAME \
--docker-password=$REGISTRY_PASSWORD \ 
--docker-email=$REGISTRY_EMAIL
```
> output: secret created

- creating a secret is not enough you need to link that secret to let openshift use it to pull the image.

```bash
oc secrets link default demo-image-pull-secret --for=pull
```
- dafault here is the service account that openshift will use, using pull because we want that secret to pull an image.
```bash
oc describe serviceaccount/default
```

> output: you should see something like this

```bash
.......
Image pull secrets:  default-dockercfg-stnvn
                     demo-image-pull-secret
.....
```
- lets confirm everything went well
```bash
oc new-app quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo --as-deployment-config
```
```bash
oc expose service/private-repo
```
```bash
oc status
```
```bash
curl <URL from oc status>
```
> output: "Hello from private image registry"

---

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For images, you'll import your own private image and tag into OpenShift.

- Create a new project called `images-lab`
- Create an image named `images-lab` based on `quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world`
- Push this image to your Quay.io accout. Keep it private
- Create another image with the tag `images-lab:private-tag`.
- Push this tag to Quay.io
- Create an ImageStream for your private images-lab image
- Import the tag into OpenShift as an ImageStreamTag
- Deploy an application based on the images-lab:private-tag image
---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- `oc get is` returns a single ImageStream
- `oc get istag`returns 2 tags for `images-lab`
- `oc get secret` shows your authentication secret
- `curl <your route>` gives you the message you supplied in step 4.

### 4.3 Builds and BuildConfigs
Builds represent the process of transforming input (like source code) into a runnable image, while BuildConfigs define the entire build process for an application. A BuildConfig acts as a template, specifying how to build an image, including the source code, build strategy, and output location. 
- A build is a specific instance of a build process triggered by a BuildConfig. 
- A BuildConfig is a resource in OpenShift that defines the build process for an application. 

**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  

- lets create a new build 

```bash
oc new-build <Git URL>
```

> output: "buildconfig.build.openshift.io "hello-world" created"

- Lets see whats inside the buildconfig

```bash
oc get -o yaml buildconfig/hello-world
```
> output: 

```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewBuild
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-19T22:53:53Z"
  generation: 2
  labels:
    build: hello-world
  name: hello-world
  namespace: raafat-dev
  resourceVersion: "3357388343"
  uid: 0d5acd9e-e53c-4d3e-a7da-50aaeda9a832
spec:
  failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 5
  nodeSelector: null
  output:

      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: hello-world:latest
  postCommit: {}
  resources: {}
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    git:
      uri: https://gitlab.com/therayy1/hello-world.git
    type: Git
  strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: golang:1.17
    type: Docker
  successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 5
  triggers:
  - github:
      secret: uEN_9w-Ftp5rVSR3Q_35
    type: GitHub
  - generic:
      secret: 8R972EmKLVDCPF5N6y7O
    type: Generic
  - type: ConfigChange
  - imageChange: {}
    type: ImageChange
```
- Lets look at the builds

```bash
oc get build
```
> output: 

| NAME | TYPE | FROM | STATUS | STARTED | DURATION|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
|hello-world-1| Docker | Git@9e4d905 | Complete | 39 minutes ago | 56s|'

- Checking build logs

```bash
oc get buildconfig
```
```bash
oc logs -f buildconfig/hello-world
```

> output: Docker steps and pushs the image!

- How to start a build "use 2 terminals"

on Terminal 1
```oc get pods -w
```
on Terminal 2
```bash
oc start-build bc/hello-world
```
> output: "build.build.openshift.io/hello-world-2 started" also on Terminal 1 you will see many events happening.

```bash
oc describe is/hello-world
```

> output: "you will find there is 2 changes happened by the time you started the build, this example we didn't push anything new - in real life example most common this would create a build based on the newest source code allowing you to test your changes."

- Cancelling Builds:

```bash
oc cancel-build bc/hello-world
```

> output: "build.build.openshift cancelled"

---

### 4.4 Webhooks
Is a method for one application to automatically send real-time data to another application when a specific event occurs. It's essentially an automated messaging system that allows applications to communicate with each other without needing to constantly "poll" or check for updates. And this is one of the key features that enables CICD!

| OpenShift | Git Repo |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Exposes HTTPS endpoint that starts when called | Calls endpoint when developers push code|

> The way the integration is set up is that the hook is exposed on the downstream system, OpenShift in our case, and the hook is configured on the upstream system. Your Git Repository is configured to call the endpoint that's exposed on OpenShift. To mitigate the risk of having a public endpoint on your OpenShift cluster, OpenShift requires Webhook clients to pass a special token string along with a request. This token value is automatically generated for BuildConfigs created with the `oc new-app` and the `oc new-build` command line tools. Once you have set up the Webhook correctly on the GitLab side, anytime a developer pushes an update GitLab will make an HTTPS request to the Webhook URL and pass along the token. When OpenShift gets the request it will start a new Build for the linked BuildConfig. This way, you can set up an automated pipeline allowing you to push automatically to your OpenShift cluster simply by pushing to a Git Repository.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/webhook.png" alt="Webhook" style="width:500px; align="center"/>
</p>


**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  

- How to call a Webhook Manually? We need 2 pieces of data!
  - Secret Token
  - Webhook URL

```bash
oc get -o yaml buildconfig/hello-world
```
> output: Look for `triggers.generic.secret` grab that copy and now you have your token.

```bash
export GENERIC_SECRET=<SECRET-FROM-BUILDCONFIG>
```
- Now we need to get the URL information 

```bash 
oc describe bc/hello-world
```
> output: look for `Webhook Generic.URL` copy and generate a variable as well.

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.rm3.7wse.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/raafat-dev/buildconfigs/hello-world/webhooks/$GENERIC_SECRET/generic
```
- Then we need to curl that URL

```bash
curl -X POST -k $WEBHOOK_URL
```
> output: we should see status `Success`

- Building from the update-message branch

```bash
oc new-build oc new-build https://gitlab.com/therayy1/hello-world.git#update-message
```
> output: we need to check the logs to verify we are at the correct branch

```bash
oc logs -f bc/helloworld
```
> output: on `step 3` ENV MESSAGE "Welcome! I was changed in a branch."

- Use --context-dir to build from a subdirectory to deploy a specific project in case you got many projects.

```bash
oc new-build https://gitlab.com/practical-openshift/labs.git --context-dir hello-world
```

- Configuring build hooks
  - First we need to clean our cluster from any builds and run `oc status` to make sure.

```bash
oc new-build https://gitlab.com/therayy1/hello-world.git 
```
> output: "Success"

```bash
oc set build-hook bc/hello-world \
  --post-commit \
  --script="echo Hello from build hook"
```
> output: "buildconfig.build.openshift.io/hello-world hooks updated"

```bash
oc describe bc/hello-world
```
> output: 
```yaml
.....
Strategy:               Docker
URL:                    https://gitlab.com/therayy1/hello-world.git
From Image:             ImageStreamTag golang:1.17
Output to:              ImageStreamTag hello-world:latest
Post Commit Hook:       ["/bin/sh", "-ic", "echo Hello from build hook"]
....
```
- Lets run a build and verify that this message shows up in the output

```bash
oc start-build bc/hello-world
```
> output: "build.build.openshift.io/hello-world-2 started"

- Now get the logs and check it out!

```bash
oc logs -f bc/hello-world
```
> output:

```yaml
[2/3] STEP 2/2: RUN /bin/sh -ic 'echo Hello from build hook'
sh: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
sh: no job control in this shell
Hello from build hook
```
- Clean up - remove build hook 

```bash
oc set build-hook bc/hello-world \
  --post-commit \
  --remove
```

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For builds, you will make a small tweak to an application, push it to GitLab, and then run it on your OpenShift instance.

- Create a new repository under your GitLab account (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html)
- Add the new repository as a remote for the labs project (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)
- Create a new branch in the labs repository named `builds-lab`
- Modify the Dockerfile in the `hello-world-go` directory to change the `MESSAGE` environment variable
- Commit the change and push it to GitLab
- Create a BuildConfig for this updated `hello-world-go` directory in the `builds-lab` branch
- Add a build hook that prints the value of the `MESSAGE` environment variable
- Deploy the application based on the resulting ImageStream
---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- oc logs `<your BuildConfig>` contains the build hook output with your `MESSAGE` value from step 5
- `curl <your app>` shows you the `MESSAGE` value from step 5
- You can start the build using the webhook manually

---

### 6.2 Triggers
Lets learn about basic automation for deployments, configuring the deployment process itself, and how to add health checks so that OpenShift can restart your pods if necessary.

- Deployment Triggers:
  - Image Change Trigger: This trigger watches an image stream in OpenShift. When the image stream or its image stream tag has a new image, if the deployment config is configured with an image change trigger,then the deployment config will roll out the new version of your application image automatically.
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/triggers.png" alt="Triggers" style="width:500px; align="center"/>
</p>
- ConfigChange Triggers:With the ConfigChange Trigger,any change to the POD template will trigger a new rollout. If you add a volume or change the image stream tag in a pod spec, then the ConfigChange Trigger will cause your deployment to roll out another version.
  
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/configchangetrigger.png" alt="ConfigChange Triggers" style="width:500px; align="center"/>
</p>

--- 

**Hands-on Walkthroughs** 
  
- How the ConfigChange Trigger works?
    - In this exmaple you need 2 windows terminals.

    ```bash
    oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
    ```
    ```bash
    oc describe dc/hello-world
    ```
    > output: look for `Triggers:       Config, Image(hello-world@latest, auto=true)` 
  -  we're going to modify the pod template, which will trigger a redeploy due to the ConfigChange trigger configured for our deployment config.
    ```bash
    # on terminal 1 
    oc get pods --watch
    ```
    ```bash
   # on terminal 2
    oc set volume dc/hello-world \
  --add \
  --type emptyDir \
  --mount-path /config-change-demo
    ```

- How to add and Remove DeploymentConfigs triggers:
  -  You learned that both the config change trigger and the image change trigger are configured by default for applications created with OC new app.
  - Lets learn how to use the `oc set triggers` command to modify the triggers with no arguments, `oc set triggers will simply print the trigger associated with the deployment config.
    
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world
    ```
    > output: should contain `type` config, image to `true`

    - To remove the triggers 
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world \ --remove --from-config
    ```
    > output: "deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world triggers updated"

    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world
    # to list the triggers
    ```
    > output: You should see `TYPE` config `VALUE` false.

    ```bash
    # to re-add the config change trigger you don't need to type `--add` once you set the trigger it Automatically adds it back
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world --from-config
    ```
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world
    ```
    > output: both `VALUES` are true.

- Lets replicate that with the image change trigger:

    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world \
  --remove\
  --from-image hello-world:latest
    ```
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world
    ```
    > output: on the list you will find only the config trigger and you will no loger find the image trigger

    - So lets reverse that!
  
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world --from-image hello-world:latest -c hello-world
    ```
    ```bash
    oc set triggers dc/hello-world
    ```
    > output: you should find both `TYPE` in with the `VALUE` of true.
