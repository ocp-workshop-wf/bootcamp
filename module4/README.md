## Module 4: Application Deployment and Management 

### 4.1 OpenShift ConfigMaps

- **Configmaps:** a fundamental way to manage configuration data for applications. They are Kubernetes API objects that store configuration data as key-value pairs, allowing you to decouple configuration from your application code and keep your containers portable. This means you can change an application's behavior without rebuilding its container image.

> - Not for sensitive data
> - 1MB limit

- ConfigMap Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
    MESSAGE: Hello from ConfigMap
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: 2025-06-11T11:40:41Z
    name: message-map
    namespace: myproject
    resourceVersion: "2827192"
    selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/myproject/configmaps/message-map
    uid: 60dc0569-abd8-11ea-9133-080027c1c30a
    ```


**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- Creating ConfigMaps:

```bash
oc create configmap message-map --from-literal MESSAGE="Hello from ConfigMap"
```
> `configmap/message-map created`
```bash
oc get cm
```
```bash
message-map         1      42s
```
```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/message-map
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: Hello from ConfigMap
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-18T01:09:39Z"
  name: message-map
  namespace: <your-namespace>
  resourceVersion: "3298865818"
  uid: 7c32526a-8837-48ba-ab36-bade0095b35b
```
- Consuming ConfigMaps:
```bash
oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
> Once app created go ahead and expouse the service!

```bash
oc expose service/hello-world
```
> Once expose was done lets run status to get the URL

```bash
oc status
```
> We will Curl before and after configmap being applied to the application, at first it should give us the default message, at 2nd it should give us the message from inside the configmap!
```bash
curl <url from oc status>
```
> output: 
"Welcome! You can change this message by editing the MESSAGE environment variable."

- Consuming a ConfigMap to the application
```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from cm/message-map
```
> output: `deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated`

```bash
curl <url from oc status>
```
> output: "Hello from ConfigMap"

```bash
oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world
```
```yaml
    .....
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              key: MESSAGE
              name: message-map
              ........
```
- Create ConfigMaps from Files:
```bash
echo "Hello from ConfigMap file" > MESSAGE.txt
```
```bash
cat MESSAGE.txt
```
> output:"Hello from ConfigMap file"

```bash
oc create configmap file-map --from-file=MESSAGE.txt
```
---

> output: "configmap/file-map created"

```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/file-map
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE.txt: |
    Hello from ConfigMap file
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
.........
```
> output: "data.MESSAGE.txt: this is the wrong syntax as it doesn't match the key in the Hello-world application"

```bash
oc create configmap file-map-2 --from-file=MESSAGE=MESSAGE.txt
```
> output: "configmap/file-map created"

```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/file-map
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: |
    Hello from ConfigMap file
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
```
> output: Now as you see the data.MESSAGE: follows the same pattern for the Hello-world application.

```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from cm/file-map-2
```
> output: "deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated"

```bash
curl < URL from oc status>
```
> output: Hello from ConfigMap file.

- Create ConfigMaps from Directories:

```bash
cd ./labs
```
```bash
oc create configmap pods-example --from-file=pods
```
> output: "configmap/pods-example created!"

```bash
oc get -o yaml configmap/pods-example
```
> output:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  pod.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod
      labels:
        app: hello-world-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          value: Hi! I'm an environment variable
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world-override
        resources: {}
  pod2.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod-2
      labels:
        app: hello-world-pod-2
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          value: Hi! I'm an environment variable in pod 2
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world-override
        resources: {}
  service.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: hello-world-pod
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080
kind: ConfigMap

```

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For ConfigMaps, you'll get some hands-on practice working with YAML. Start with the following ConfigMap definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: lab-map
```
- Create a new file called lab-configmap.yaml
- Copy the above YAML into the file
- Modify this YAML so that the ConfigMap will have the proper key fro the hello-world application
- Us `oc create` to create the ConfigMap from the file
- Deploy the `quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world` image using `oc new-app`
- Change the message that the `DeploymentConfig` uses to the ConfigMap value using the `oc set env` command
- Expose a route for your application.

---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- Output from `oc get cm` contains your new ConfigMap

- Output from `oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world` contains the string `configMapKeyRef`

- When you run `curl <your route>` you get the value you put in the ConfigMap

---

### 4.2 Secrets

- Secrets: a Kubernetes resource designed to hold sensitive information like passwords, API keys, certificates, and other credentials.
  - Basic Auth
  - SSH Key 
  - TLS Auth


**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- Create an Opaque secret

```bash
oc create secret generic message-secret --from-literal MESSAGE="secret message"
```
> output: secret/message-secret created

- Lets find out where it is!

```bash
oc get secret
```
> output: "message-secret        Opaque            10s"

- Lets open the yaml for that secret.

```bash
oc get -o yaml secrete/message-secret
```
> output:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: c2VjcmV0IG1lc3NhZ2U=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-19T03:42:04Z"
  name: message-secret
  namespace: raafat-dev
  resourceVersion: "3334020540"
  uid: d1e28fce-ab5d-45a3-8e9f-526f83d20135
type: Opaque
```
- This message is base64.

- How to use a Secret as environment variables

```bash
oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
```bash
oc expose svc/hello-world /
oc status
```
```bash
curl <url from oc status> 
```

> output: "Welcome! You can change this message by editing the MESSAGE environment variable."

```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from secret/message-secret
```
> output: "deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated"

```bash
curl <URL from oc status>
```
> output: "secret message"

```bash
oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world
```
```yaml
  .....
 - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              key: MESSAGE
              name: message-secret
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world@sha256:2311b7a279608de9547454d1548e2de7e37e981b6f84173f2f452854d81d1b7e
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world
      .......
```
---

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For secrets, you will update a secret value by modifying its definition. Start with the following secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: YmFzZTY0
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lab-secret
type: Opaque
```
- Create a new file and put the above YAML inside
- Update the value of MESSAGE to "Hello from Lab Secret"
- Create a secret based on this YAML using `oc create -f`
- Deploy and expose the Hello World Application
- Set the MESSAGE environment varaible using the secret.
---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- Output from `oc get secret` contains your new Secret

- Output from `oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world` contains the string "secretKeyRef"

- When you run `curl <your route>` you get the value you put in the Secret

---
### Quiz
> Q1: You can use all the same inputs for ConfigMaps in order to create Secrets.
- [ ] Fales
- [ ] True

<details>
  <summary> Answer </summary>

  True

</details>

> Q2: The data stored in a secret resource is securely encrypted. Even if someone could read the secret, they wouldn't get access to the information inside.
- [ ] Fales
- [ ] True

<details>
  <summary> Answer </summary>

  False "Base64 is not a secure encryption method"

</details>

> Q3: What format do secrets use for their values?

### 4.3 Images and Image Streams 
An image is a self-contained package containing everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. An image stream, on the other hand, is a way to manage and track different versions of an image within OpenShift, acting as a virtual image repository. 

![Image & Image Steams architecture](/images/image-imagestream.png)

**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- How to create an ImageStream

```bash
oc get is
```
> output: 

| Name  | IMAGE REPOSITORY |  TAGS |UPDATED|
| -------- | ------- | ------- | -----| 
| Hello-World  | `default-route-openshift-image-registry..` | latest | 27 hours ago|          
---
```bash
oc delete is/hello-world
```
> output: "imagestream.image.openshift.io "hello-world" deleted"

- Lets import the image now.

```bash
oc import-image --confirm quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
```
> output: "imagestream.image.openshift.io/hello-world imported" In addition to image description such as: 

```bash
Name:                   hello-world
Namespace:              raafat-dev
Created:                Less than a second ago
Labels:                 <none>
Annotations:            openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2025-07-19T05:09:16Z
Image Repository:       default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.rm3.7wse.p1.openshiftapps.com/raafat-dev/hello-world
Image Lookup:           local=false
Unique Images:          1
Tags:                   1

latest
  tagged from quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
```
- To get more information
```bash
oc get istag
```
- Once you have the name run the command to describe it:

```md
oc describe istag/<name>:latest
```
- What can you even do with an imagestream after importing it to OpenShift?
> you can easier to deploy a new app using that image

```bash
oc new-app myproject/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
- How to add more ImageStreamTags
```bash
oc tag quay.io/image-name:tag image-name:tag
```
- Syntax (oc tag `<orignial>` `<destination>`)
```bash
oc tag quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world:update-message hello-world:update-message
```
> output:"Tag hello-world:update-message set to quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world:update-message"

```bash
oc get is
```
> output: you should be able to see `update-message` on the tag

```bash
oc get istag
```

> output: you should see both images with the tag `latest` and `update-message`

- Lets learn how to push a private image on quay.io

```bash
export $REGISTRY_USERNAME=<your-username>
```
```bash
cd ./labs-repo/hello-world-go-private
```
```bash
cat Dockerfile
```
- Now we need to push the image, but we need to be very careful about the syntax for remote tags

|HOST|Repository|Image Name (:tag)|
| ----| ---- | ----|
|quay.io|/practicalopenshift|/private-repo
---
```bash
docker build -t quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo .
```
>output "[+] Building 16.8s (5/5) FINISHED"

```bash 
docker login quay.io
```
- Push 
```docker push quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo
```
> output: Access your quay.io and look for private-repo with a red lock on it which means its private, also on your terminal you should see something like this: 

```bash
The push refers to repository [quay.io/`USERNAME`/private-repo]
7b2225181d6b: Pushed 
08684ee472f3: Pushed 
c732a2540651: Pushed

```
- How to run this private image to OpenShift?

```bash
oc new-app quay.io/$REGISTRY_USERNAME/private-repo --as-deployment-config
```
> output: 
```bash
.......
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "private-repo" created
    service "private-repo" created
......
```
- In case you get an Authentication error, you need to run the following command
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry \ demo-image-pull-secret \
--docker-server=$REGISTRY_HOST \
--docker-username=$REGISTRY_USERNAME \
--docker-password=$REGISTRY_PASSWORD \ 
--docker-email=$REGISTRY_EMAIl
```
