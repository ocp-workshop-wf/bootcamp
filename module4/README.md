## Module 4: Application Deployment and Management 

### 4.1 OpenShift ConfigMaps

- **Configmaps:** a fundamental way to manage configuration data for applications. They are Kubernetes API objects that store configuration data as key-value pairs, allowing you to decouple configuration from your application code and keep your containers portable. This means you can change an application's behavior without rebuilding its container image.

- ConfigMap Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
    MESSAGE: Hello from ConfigMap
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: 2025-06-11T11:40:41Z
    name: message-map
    namespace: myproject
    resourceVersion: "2827192"
    selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/myproject/configmaps/message-map
    uid: 60dc0569-abd8-11ea-9133-080027c1c30a
    ```


**Hands-on Walkthroughs**  
- Creating ConfigMaps:

```bash
oc create configmap message-map --from-literal MESSAGE="Hello from ConfigMap"
```
> `configmap/message-map created`
```bash
oc get cm
```
```bash
message-map         1      42s
```
```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/message-map
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: Hello from ConfigMap
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-18T01:09:39Z"
  name: message-map
  namespace: <your-namespace>
  resourceVersion: "3298865818"
  uid: 7c32526a-8837-48ba-ab36-bade0095b35b
```
- Consuming ConfigMaps:
```bash
oc new-app quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world --as-deployment-config
```
> Once app created go ahead and expouse the service!

```bash
oc expose service/hello-world
```
> Once expose was done lets run status to get the URL

```bash
oc status
```
> We will Curl before and after configmap being applied to the application, at first it should give us the default message, at 2nd it should give us the message from inside the configmap!
```bash
curl <url from oc status>
```
> output: 
"Welcome! You can change this message by editing the MESSAGE environment variable."

- Consuming a ConfigMap to the application
```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from cm/message-map
```
> output: `deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated`

```bash
curl <url from oc status>
```
> output: "Hello from ConfigMap"

```bash
oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world
```
```yaml
    .....
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              key: MESSAGE
              name: message-map
              ........
```
- Create ConfigMaps from Files:
```bash
echo "Hello from ConfigMap file" > MESSAGE.txt
```
```bash
cat MESSAGE.txt
```
> output:"Hello from ConfigMap file"

```bash
oc create configmap file-map --from-file=MESSAGE.txt
```
---

> output: "configmap/file-map created"

```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/file-map
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE.txt: |
    Hello from ConfigMap file
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
.........
```
> output: "data.MESSAGE.txt: this is the wrong syntax as it doesn't match the key in the Hello-world application"

```bash
oc create configmap file-map-2 --from-file=MESSAGE=MESSAGE.txt
```
> output: "configmap/file-map created"

```bash
oc get -o yaml cm/file-map
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  MESSAGE: |
    Hello from ConfigMap file
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
```
> output: Now as you see the data.MESSAGE: follows the same pattern for the Hello-world application.

```bash
oc set env dc/hello-world --from cm/file-map-2
```
> output: "deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/hello-world updated"

```bash
curl < URL from oc status>
```
> output: Hello from ConfigMap file.

- Create ConfigMaps from Directories:

```bash
cd ./labs
```
```bash
oc create configmap pods-example --from-file=pods
```
> output: "configmap/pods-example created!"

```bash
oc get -o yaml configmap/pods-example
```
> output:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  pod.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod
      labels:
        app: hello-world-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          value: Hi! I'm an environment variable
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world-override
        resources: {}
  pod2.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod-2
      labels:
        app: hello-world-pod-2
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          value: Hi! I'm an environment variable in pod 2
        image: quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: hello-world-override
        resources: {}
  service.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pod-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: hello-world-pod
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080
kind: ConfigMap

```

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For ConfigMaps, you'll get some hands-on practice working with YAML. Start with the following ConfigMap definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: lab-map
```
- Create a new file called lab-configmap.yaml
- Copy the above YAML into the file
- Modify this YAML so that the ConfigMap will have the proper key fro the hello-world application
- Us `oc create` to create the ConfigMap from the file
- Deploy the `quay.io/practicalopenshift/hello-world` image using `oc new-app`
- Change the message that the `DeploymentConfig` uses to the ConfigMap value using the `oc set env` command
- Expose a route for your application.

---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- Output from `oc get cm` contains your new ConfigMap

- Output from `oc get -o yaml dc/hello-world` contains the string `configMapKeyRef`

- When you run `curl <your route>` you get the value you put in the ConfigMap
