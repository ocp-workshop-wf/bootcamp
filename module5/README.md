## Module 5: Advanced App Deployment

### 5.1 Source-to-image (S2I)
 It is a toolkit and workflow that automates the process of building container images from source code. It takes a builder image (containing necessary build tools and dependencies) and source code, then combines them to create a runnable application image. S2I is used to create reproducible container images, making it easier for developers to deploy and manage applications in various environments, including OpenShift.

 > It uses `Assemble` script vs `Run` from Docker and `Run` vs `CMD` from Docker.

 - FAQ: Why do I want another way to build and run applications?so what advantage does S2I have?
 
    - The first advantage is that the developer can rely on the expertise of the S2I authors to make sure the image will be OpenShift compatible.
    - The second advantage is that developers can avoid writing and maintaining Dockerfiles and other configuration by using the S2I defaults. 

**Hands-on Walkthroughs** 
- How to build an app using S2I?
> the source of this lesson will be in you Labs directory `/s2i/ruby/`

```bash
cd ./s2i/ruby
```
```bash
oc new-app ruby~https://gitlab.com/therayy1/openshif-labs.git --context-dir s2i/ruby --as-deployment-config
```

```bash
oc logs -f bc/openshif-labs
```
> output: push successful 

```bash
oc get pods
```
> output: you will be able to see all pods related to this deployment

```bash
oc expose svc/openshif-labs
```
> output: "route.route.openshift.io/openshif-labs exposed"

```bash
oc get route
```
> output: URL under `HOST/PORT` copy it please!

```bash
curl <URL>
```
> output: "Hello world from Ruby"

- How S2I language auto-detect works?!
- How does OpenShift know when to use S2I? And specifically, how did OpenShift know how to use the Ruby S2I builder?

  - When you start a build with OpenShift, OpenShift will first look for a dockerfile. If it finds one it will build usig something called the Docker Strategy. If OpenShift does not find a dockerfile it will attempt to use the Source Strategy instead.

### ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Lab: 
For S2I, you'll deploy a Python application without a Dockerfile and override an S2I script.

- If you haven't pushed your own version of the labs project to your GitLab account, you should follow the steps in the Builds lab to push your own version of the labs repository
- Create a new OpenShift project called `s2i-labs`
- Deploy an application using `oc new-app` with the python builder image for the `s2i/python` directory from the labs project for this course
- Create a route for your application
- Add an S2I override for the `run` script that prints a message and then calls the default `run` script
- Start a new build for the application

---

### Checklist ðŸ“‹: 
- `curl <your route>` returns the Python hello world message
- `oc status` has a Route, Service, DeploymentConfig, and BuildConfig
- `oc logs <your Pod>` output contains the message you put in the override in step 5
